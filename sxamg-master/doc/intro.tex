\section{Overview}

\verb|SXAMG| is an AMG (Algebraic Multi-Grid) solver 
library for sparse linear system, \verb|Ax = b|. 
The initial code is from FASP project, \url{http://fasp.sourceforge.net}, which implements a collection of Krylov solvers, AMG solvers and preconditioners.

The library is serial and written by C.
It is designed for Linux, Unix and Mac systems. However, 
it is also possible to compile under Windows if user generates a file \verb|include/config.h| manually,
where \verb|USE_UNIX| should be set to 0. 

\verb|SXAMG| rewrites all the data structures, subroutines, and file structures, and it removes many components of the original implementation and third-party package dependency.
The purpose of this refactorization is to provide a standalone AMG solver to support 
other numerical applications and to validate new ideas in the future. 
The \verb|SXAMG| can serve as a solver and a preconditioning method.
